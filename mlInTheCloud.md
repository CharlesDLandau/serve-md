# ü§ñ‚ûØüå© (Machine Learning In the Cloud)

I've been preparing a talk for my local ML usergitgroup and as a result I've had to synthesize a lot of ideas. In the talk I introduce a wide variety of "Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS)" services and talk about how they fit in your toolkit. It's supposed to be a 45 minute talk, so the deck is pretty long... much longer than you would want for a blog post. In this post I'm going to:

1. Summarize the heck outta this talk.
2. Share the slides at the end.

_Note: I am NOT affiliated with ANY product mentioned ANYWHERE in this post._

## MLaaS...

...because what the world really needs is another aaS right?

Machine Learning as a Service is a tautology -- it's a label for any service that delivers machine learning. These services offer a variety of advantages to businesses and data scientists, such as:

* Near-State of the Art performance in some cases, without the up-front cost (e.g. training on many GPUs in parallel for many hours). Big Four firms (and their cloud plays) obviously have advantages when it comes to this space, especially in terms of their access to data. (See: [Google Natural Language]([https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/)))
* ‚ÄúNo Data Science Knowledge Required‚Äù and ‚ÄúAutoML‚Äù services that enable rapid prototyping and other optimizations. (See: [H20 Driverless AI](https://www.h2o.ai/products/h2o-driverless-ai/](https://www.h2o.ai/products/h2o-driverless-ai/)))
* Platforms that enhance time-to-market, optimize cost, or offer simplified integrations with supporting services. (See: [Azure ML Studio]([https://studio.azureml.net/](https://studio.azureml.net/)))
*  APIs that map endpoints to ML behaviors like training or prediction. (See: [wit.ai](https://wit.ai))
* Embed ML capabilities into devices (See: [Hover2](https://gethover.com))

## Service Categories

To give a better overview of the landscape I pulled out a few categories of services that are out there for you to use. These are **non-exhaustive and overlapping** categories that map to common use cases.
![ml_service_cats](https://serve-md.charlesdlandau.net/img/ml_service_cats.png)

### 1. NLP Services
NLP is an area where SOTA results are expensive, use cases may lend themselves to generic OOTB solutions, and large enterprise may simply have better access to data than market entrants. Some services in this category include:

* [AWS Comprehend and Comprehend Medical]([https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/))
* [GCP Actions for Google Home, Web Content, and Android]([https://developers.google.com/actions/](https://developers.google.com/actions/))

### 2. AutoML
AutoML and "No Data Science Required" services are developed using techniques like transfer learning, heuristics, Bayesian hyperparameter tuning, platform optimizations, and more. They're probably doing proprietary stuff that we may never even hear about. Services in this category include:

* [...AutoML]([https://cloud.google.com/automl/](https://cloud.google.com/automl/))
* [Watson]([https://www.ibm.com/watson](https://www.ibm.com/watson))

Services in the AutoML space also have begun trying to distinguish themselves using "explainable AI" features. These are accomplished with techniques like LIME, which perturb the inputs and use the perturbations to infer how much the model values that input towards the final prediction.

### 3. ML Data Services
There's a wide world of "managed Apache" out there, for example Spark as a Service products are available at all major cloud providers. One place that's looking pretty interesting right now is data labeling, with services like:

* [Scale AI]([https://scale.com/](https://scale.com/))
* [SageMaker Ground Truth]([https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/groundtruth/](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/groundtruth/))

The idea behind these services is to use human labelers frequently until a model can begin to infer the labels. As the model gets better at labeling the data, only the observations where the model has low confidence get referred to human labelers.

### 4. ML as an API
This might be the category with the greatest overlap to other categories, but it's the easiest to grasp. Any API that serves predictions or training endpoints, fits in this category. Some notables include:

 * [Google Vision]([https://cloud.google.com/vision/](https://cloud.google.com/vision/))
 * [Azure Personalizer]([https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/personalizer/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/personalizer/))

### 5. Embedded AI
I'm definitely stretching the definition of an "embedded system" when I use this category, but the basic idea is just devices that ship with built-in ML features, or that plug into your devices to imbue them with ML magic. Such products include:

* [Alexa Auto]([https://www.amazon.com/alexa-auto](https://www.amazon.com/alexa-auto))
* [Pixel Buds]([https://store.google.com/product/google_pixel_buds](https://store.google.com/product/google_pixel_buds))

### Bonus: JaaS
![jaas_examples](https://serve-md.charlesdlandau.net/img/jaas_examples.png)

Jupyter as a Service products like Google Colab and Datalore have been around for a long time now, so if you haven't checked them out yet now's the time. They're very mature. They don't replace an IDE, but have some great features and can be a great option for when you don't actually need a full-fledged IDE. Tools like [JupyterHub]([https://jupyter.org/hub](https://jupyter.org/hub)) can create a unified experience with reproducible experiments available alongside their documentation.
